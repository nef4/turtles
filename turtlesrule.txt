turtles have shells 
turtles live happily in Central Park 
The idea of the state is, or should be, a very limited, prescribed idea. 
The state looks after the defense of the realm, and other matters - 
raising revenue to pay for things which are for all of us, and so on. 
That idea has turned turtle now. 
The state isn't any longer perceived as an institution which exists to serve us.
Tom Stoppard
